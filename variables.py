"This is where i will show you the basics ok?"

# to add comments to code you need to start with a hashtag like i did

# there are a few types of numbers

# there are "ints" and "floats"
# an int is a full number (10, 45, 100..)
# an float is (0.1, 1,5...)

# an int or float are variables so they save values

int1 = 1
float1 = 1.5

# to save text you use strings
# a string needs to be between " " or ' '

string1 = "This is an example"

# to save a value which is true or false we use booleans (bool)

bool1 = True
bool2 = False

# to store a lot of items in 1 variable we use lists, dicts or tuples
# but nobody i know uses tuples

List1 = ["String1", "String2"] 
Dict1 = {"name" : "paul", "lastname" : "peters"} # be sure to use the right symboles

# you can also save multiple dicts in a list

"those are the basic datatypes of python"
